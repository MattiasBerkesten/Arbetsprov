This solution ai built with HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript.

To run the solution just open the main.html in your browser and then you are ready to go.

The API is from Arbetsförmedlingen and vill return different Swedish counties eg. Stockholms Län.

The API-call is only performed one time and then the solution will filter the suggestions.

Writing something and clicks enter (submiting the form) add the value to the list of previous searchresults. Clicking on a suggestion will also add that one to the list.

The styling is divided to three files: normalize
,common and style. Common contains styles that are for general html-elements while style is used for specific styling.

The font's is not according to the design, but the font-family "Avenir" (found from the SVG icons) is not free of charge. In a real project I can assume that those will be available and imported with @font-face-rules in the CSS.

Hope you enjoy the solution
Best regards
